"""Capacity management for the falaw cache: see what is on disk, and reclaim it.

Before thorwhalen/falaw#14 the cache held kilobyte JSON manifests. It now
content-addresses every media result, so it also holds the **bytes** of every
generated image, clip and audio track. On any machine that has rendered a real
project that is gigabytes, and on the production box (a 40 GB volume) it is a
capacity question rather than a cosmetic one.

Nothing here runs automatically, and that is the design rather than an omission.
**Deleting a blob is a spending decision**: :func:`falaw.plan.execute` treats a
cache entry it cannot turn back into bytes as a *miss* and re-executes it, so
disk reclaimed today is re-billed the next time that beat renders. Every prune
is therefore ``dry_run=True`` by default and returns a :class:`PruneReport`
that says — before anything is removed — how many cache entries the prune would
put back on the invoice.

The cache has six areas, with very different economics — and only one of them
is genuinely cheap to reclaim:

``manifests``
    The fal responses, keyed by call. Small. Dropping one **re-bills that
    call**, unconditionally.
``content``
    The content-addressed blobs (falaw#14). This is where the gigabytes are.
    Dropping one re-bills every call whose asset URL has since expired — fal
    deletes expired files permanently, so the blob was the last copy.
``assets``
    :func:`falaw.materialize_asset` output — a *copy* of a blob, not a hard
    link (deliberately; see :func:`falaw.content.write_blob_to_file`). It
    doubles the on-disk cost of every materialized asset and is the **cheapest**
    thing to reclaim: while the blob survives, re-materializing is a local copy
    and costs nothing.
``url_index``
    ``url -> content hash`` hints. Tiny — and **not** droppable freely, despite
    the name. :func:`falaw.content.content_ref_for_url` reaches a blob *only*
    through :func:`falaw.content.remembered_ref`, so deleting this index orphans
    the entire ``content`` area: every entry whose fal URL has since expired
    re-**renders**, and the bytes it needed are still on disk, unreachable.
    Nothing here prunes it.
``scenes``
    Saved Scene IR. Not media and not a cache — it is *authored input*, so
    losing one is lost work rather than a re-render. Nothing here prunes it.
``other``
    Whatever the named areas do not claim: a crashed write's ``.part``
    leftover, or a directory a future falaw feature adds without telling this
    module. Present so that the totals cannot silently under-report.

Examples
--------

What is actually on disk, broken down by area (``+SKIP``\\ ed because it reads
the caller's real cache, which on the production box is a multi-gigabyte walk —
:mod:`tests.test_prune` pins the same behaviour against a throwaway one):

>>> usage = cache_usage()                            # doctest: +SKIP
>>> sorted(a.name for a in usage.areas)              # doctest: +SKIP
['assets', 'content', 'manifests', 'other', 'scenes', 'url_index']

A prune is a dry run unless you say otherwise, and refuses to run unbounded
(this one raises before touching the disk, so it is safe to execute):

>>> prune_content()
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
ValueError: prune_content needs a bound: pass older_than= and/or max_bytes=...

    area, and each is a different claim:

    - ``manifests`` — every dropped entry re-bills, so it equals the candidate
      count.
    - ``content`` — entries whose recorded response names an asset that resolves
      (through the ``url -> hash`` index) to a blob being dropped. Those become
      *unmaterializable* from cache; they re-download if fal still serves the
      URL and re-render if it does not, and falaw cannot tell which from here.
      It mirrors the predicate :func:`falaw.plan.execute` applies to a hit from
      the **built-in** converter. It is therefore an *upper* bound, not an exact

      dropped (it returns a broken artifact instead), and with
      ``fetch_bytes=False`` dropping the blob changes nothing. Both errors are
      overcounts — the safe direction for a number you read before spending.
    - ``assets`` — only the copies whose blob is *also* gone. While the blob
      survives, re-materializing is a local copy and costs nothing.

    ``unreferenced_candidates`` is the other half of the story, and only
    ``content`` populates it: blobs that **no manifest points at**. falaw cannot
    tell whether such a blob is garbage or the last copy of something
    irreplaceable — :func:`falaw.materialize_asset` puts reference images and
    locally-rendered ``file://`` media in the same store, and those never had a
    fal response behind them. Counting them as ``rebillable`` would be wrong
