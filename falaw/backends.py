"""Execution backend registry — where `CallPlan.backend` dispatches (falaw#15).

Until this module existed, "make the vendor call" meant one hardcoded path:
`falaw.core.call_fal`. That is a budget bypass waiting to happen — the
video_gen research programme's decisions of record (§3.2) put it plainly:
*"Do not write a ComfyUI Transform before this lands. A flavor without a
priceable Plan is a budget bypass."* A backend reachable only by overriding
`Transform.execute` wholesale returns `Plan(calls=())`, so
`Plan.total_cost_usd` reads $0.00 on a real spend and every downstream
consumer of `Plan` — the cache, the dry-run converter, the cost gate — never
sees the call happen.

The fix is the smallest one that closes that gap: `CallPlan` gains a
`backend: str` field (default :data:`falaw.canonical.DFLT_BACKEND`, i.e.
`"fal"`), and `execute_isolated` resolves it through this module's `backends`
registry instead of calling `call_fal` directly. Everything else about a
`CallPlan` — its cost estimate, its cache key, its artifact conversion —
stays exactly what it already is, because the executor's contract is
narrow: turn `(application, arguments)` into the vendor's *raw* response,
in the same shape :func:`falaw.core.call_fal` already returns. Converting
that raw response into a `lacing.Artifact` remains `execute`'s job, uniform
across backends.

Nothing above `falaw.Plan` may know a specific backend exists. A module that
imports a backend type, references a vendor node name, or assumes a
backend's execution semantics is an architecture bug regardless of whether
it works — this registry is the one seam allowed to know backends exist at
all.

Register a second backend with ``backends.register(name, executor)``, then
build ``CallPlan(..., backend=name)``. See
``docs/comfyui_integration_plan.md`` (video_gen research programme) for the
two-tier ruling this registry is the executor half of: a ``nw.Transform``
comfy *flavor* is the graph **template** and never opens a socket; a
`GraphExecutionBackend` registered here is the **executor**.
