"""Content-addressed cache for fal calls.

Why this exists: the directorial workflow ("a single edit, the scene
re-renders around it") only works if unchanged beats *don't* re-render.
A cache hit is the difference between a 30-second edit-and-preview
loop and a 5-minute one.

Design:

* Key = SHA256 of (model_id, sorted(arguments_json)). Two structurally
  identical fal calls collapse to the same key.
* Value = the raw fal response, plus optional locally-downloaded asset
  paths. We persist both the JSON manifest and the binary downloads.
* Cache root: ``$FALAW_CACHE_DIR`` or ``$FALAW_DATA_DIR/cache`` or
  ``~/.config/falaw/cache``.
* The cache is *per-process* aware via lru_cache for hot lookups;
  on-disk for persistence across runs.

**The key arguments are not always the wire arguments.** A chained plan
(``generate_image`` → ``image_to_video``) sends fal a *URL* for the upstream
image, but a URL is minted fresh per upload — so keying on it guarantees a
miss the moment the upstream is genuinely re-executed, and the miss re-bills
the expensive downstream call for unchanged work. :func:`cached_call_fal`
therefore takes an optional ``key_arguments``: the same call with upstream
references resolved to **content hashes** (``sha256:<hex>``) instead of URLs.
See :mod:`falaw.content` for how those hashes are produced.

Usage:

    from falaw.cache import cached_call_fal
    raw = cached_call_fal("fal-ai/flux/dev", {"prompt": "..."})

The wrapped variant has the same signature as `core.call_fal` but skips
the network when the (model_id, arguments) tuple was seen before.

    The local filename is content-addressed by the asset's **bytes**, so two
    URLs serving identical bytes resolve to one file. The extension is a
    presentational hint for ffmpeg/PIL; the SHA-256 is the address.

    Repeat calls are cheap, in three widening circles — this is what makes it
    safe to call from a loop over 200 shots:

    1. the file is already on disk here (no store lookup, no network) —
       **immutable URLs only**, see below;
    2. the bytes are in the content store (no network, or one validating
       round-trip) — so it still works after fal has expired the URL;
    3. otherwise, one download.

    Circle 1 matters on its own: the content store is prunable, so an asset
    can survive as a materialized file after its blob is gone.

    **Circle 1 is taken only when the URL cannot change** — that is,
    :func:`falaw.content.is_immutable_url` — because reaching it requires
    trusting the ``url -> hash`` index to name the *current* bytes, and for an
    arbitrary caller-supplied URL it does not (thorwhalen/falaw#23). A mutable
    URL goes to circle 2, where :func:`falaw.content.content_ref_for_url`
    revalidates before reusing anything; when the bytes really are unchanged
    that costs one conditional request and still no download, and when they
    have changed you get the new file instead of silently getting the old one.

    Args:
        url: the remote asset URL. ``file://`` is supported and is used
            deliberately by downstream packages for locally-rendered media.
        key_hint: optional human-readable filename prefix.
        store: injected :class:`lacing.ArtifactStore`; defaults to

        fetcher: injected byte source (``url -> Iterable[bytes]``); defaults to
            the ``urllib``-based one. The seam for custom transport (auth
            headers, retries) and for a hermetic test suite.
        refresh: re-fetch unconditionally, skipping every circle. Rarely needed
            now: a mutable URL revalidates on its own (falaw#23), so this is for
            an origin that lies about its validators.

    Raises:
        falaw.errors.FalAssetFetchError: the bytes could not be retrieved.

            see :func:`falaw.plan.execute`), there is nothing to degrade to
