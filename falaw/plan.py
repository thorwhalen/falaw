"""Plan / Execute primitives — separate planning (data) from execution (effects).

Today every falaw operation is eager: ``generate_image(prompt)`` makes the
API call immediately. That means:

- A budget gate has to predict cost from outside the call and *hope* the
  prediction matches what the operation will actually do.
- Tests need a fake fal_client to exercise any code that touches an
  operation, even when the test is about composition or cost.
- A UI can't show "you're about to spend $4.12, click confirm" without
  a separate, parallel cost-prediction code path.

The fix is to give every operation two surfaces:

1. ``plan_X(...) -> CallPlan``: pure data describing the call that *would*
   happen — model_id, arguments, predicted cost, cache status. No API contact.
2. ``execute(plan, ...) -> list[Artifact]``: turns a Plan (one or more
   CallPlans) into materialized Artifacts. The eager wrappers
   (``generate_image``, etc.) are now thin: ``execute(plan_X(...))[0]``.

A higher-level orchestrator (a music-video render, a storyboard generation)
builds a Plan by composing CallPlans across multiple operations. The Plan
gets a typed ``total_cost_usd``, can be inspected, edited, dry-run, or
serialized — all without the network.

Examples
--------

>>> from falaw.plan import CallPlan, Plan
>>> p1 = CallPlan(
...     tool="generate_image",
...     application="fal-ai/flux/dev",
...     arguments={"prompt": "a tiger", "image_size": "landscape_4_3"},
...     output_kind="image",
...     estimated_cost_usd=0.025,
...     cache_status="miss",
... )
>>> p2 = CallPlan(
...     tool="image_to_video",
...     application="fal-ai/minimax/hailuo-02/pro/image-to-video",
...     arguments={"image_url": "<from p1>"},
...     output_kind="video",
...     estimated_cost_usd=0.50,
...     cache_status="miss",
... )
>>> plan = Plan(calls=(p1, p2))
>>> plan.total_cost_usd
0.525
>>> plan.cache_hit_savings_usd
0.0
>>> [c.tool for c in plan.calls]
['generate_image', 'image_to_video']

Plans concatenate, so an orchestrator can build one shot's Plan and then
append it to a scene-level Plan:

>>> shot_plan = Plan(calls=(p1,))
>>> scene_plan = Plan(calls=()) + shot_plan + Plan(calls=(p2,))
>>> len(scene_plan.calls)
2

    to replay a resumed render for free. It is computed *before* execution and
    with ``<from N>`` placeholders intact, so it is stable across re-plans of the
    same structural request.

    The digest canonicalizes each call over ``{app, args, tool}``
    (:func:`falaw.canonical.plan_identity_payload`) — matching
    :func:`_synthetic_artifact`'s canonicalization, and deliberately **not** the

    ``{app, args}`` with no ``tool``). ``plan_hash`` and the per-call cache key

    cannot represent faithfully raises
    :class:`falaw.errors.FalNonCanonicalArgument` instead of colliding, and a
    new identity-bearing field is an explicit decision about both hashes.

    Two structurally-identical plans hash equal; changing any call's ``app``,
    ``args``, or ``tool`` — or the *order* of calls — changes the hash.

            rooted in the falaw cache). Point this at an S3-backed store to
            share content — and therefore cache hits — across machines.
        fetch_bytes: Whether to download each media result so its ``asset_id``
            is the SHA-256 of its bytes. Defaults to :data:`DFLT_FETCH_BYTES`
            (true), overridable process-wide via :data:`FETCH_BYTES_ENVVAR`.
            **Opting out forfeits caching for chained calls**: without bytes
            there is no content hash, so downstream calls fall back to keying
            on the upstream URL — which fal mints fresh per upload, so the
            downstream entry can never be reused across runs or machines. It
            also means ``asset_id`` is *not* a content hash, in violation of
            ``lacing.Artifact``'s contract. Use it only when you genuinely
            want URL-only artifacts and no reuse.
        asset_fetcher: Injected byte source (``url -> Iterable[bytes]``) used to
            read media results; defaults to
            :func:`falaw.content.default_url_fetcher`. This is the per-call
            transport seam. A **hermetic test suite** usually wants the
            process-wide one instead — :func:`falaw.testing.fake_assets`, built
            on :func:`falaw.content.using_url_fetcher` — because a suite
            reaching falaw *through* its own public API has no ``execute``
            call site to pass this to. Passing it here still wins over any
            installed default. (``$FALAW_FETCH_ARTIFACT_BYTES=0`` also silences
            the network, but by turning content addressing off — see
            :data:`FETCH_BYTES_ENVVAR`.)
        concurrency: How many calls may be in flight at once. ``1``
            (:data:`DFLT_CONCURRENCY`) runs the Plan sequentially, on the
            calling thread, exactly as it always has. Above 1, independent calls
            run on a thread pool bounded by this number — a Plan is I/O-bound
            (an HTTP request that fal takes tens of seconds to answer), so
            threads are the right tool and the bound is what keeps a 200-call
            fan-out from becoming 200 simultaneous paid requests. **Chained
            calls are never parallelised with their producers**: a call holding
            a ``"<from N>"`` placeholder waits for call ``N``. Two things to
            weigh before raising it: the vendor's rate limit, and memory —
            materializing a media result peaks at roughly twice the asset's size
            (thorwhalen/lacing#25), so ``concurrency`` multiplies the peak.

    Failure handling — a paid result is never discarded
    ---------------------------------------------------
    Two different things can go wrong when reading a result's bytes, and they
    get two different answers:

    - **A fresh call whose bytes cannot be fetched.** fal has already run — and
      billed — the generation. Raising would throw away a result we paid for,
      typically over a transient network failure. So the artifact **degrades**:
      ``url`` is kept, ``bytes_size`` stays 0, ``asset_id`` is a digest of the
      response and is *not* claimed to be a content hash, and a
      :class:`UserWarning` is emitted. Downstream key resolution reads
      ``bytes_size == 0`` and falls back to the URL — a guaranteed cache
      *miss*, never a wrong hit.
    - **A cache hit that cannot be materialized** — fal deleted the URL and the
      bytes are not in the content store. The entry is unusable, so it is
      treated as a **miss**: it is invalidated and the call re-executed once.
      A cache must never become a trap whose only escape is re-billing the
      whole plan with ``use_cache=False``.

    Placeholder resolution — the wire/key split
    -------------------------------------------
    Any string argument equal to ``"<from N>"`` (for an integer ``N``) is
    rewritten *just before* the call is made — so a multi-step plan (e.g.
    generate_image → image_to_video) can reference the upstream output without
    the planner needing to know its URL. The rewrite happens after the upstream
    call has executed; planning itself is unaffected.

    It happens **twice**, into two different argument sets, because the same
    value cannot serve both jobs:

    - the **wire** arguments get ``artifacts[N].url`` — what fal needs in order
      to fetch the input;
    - the **key** arguments get ``sha256:<artifacts[N].asset_id>`` — the
      upstream's content hash, so a byte-identical upstream regeneration
      produces a downstream cache *hit* instead of re-billing the expensive
      call. Keying on the URL instead is the defect this split exists to fix
      (falaw#14): fal mints a unique URL per upload, so a URL-keyed downstream
      entry is unreachable the moment the upstream genuinely re-runs.

    An upstream artifact with no materialized bytes has no content hash, so its
    key ref falls back to the URL — a guaranteed miss, never a wrong hit.

    Returns:
        One :class:`lacing.Artifact` per :class:`CallPlan` in ``plan.calls``,
        in the same order.

    The fan-out counterpart of :func:`execute`. Where ``execute`` raises on the

    fal has already billed — this returns an :class:`~falaw.ExecutionReport`
    carrying one :class:`~falaw.CallOutcome` per call: the successes with their
    artifacts, the failures with their exceptions, and the calls that never ran
    with the reason why.

    ``len(report.outcomes) == len(plan.calls)`` always, so a caller that built
    something per call can zip against ``report.outcomes`` and stay aligned.

    Args:
        halt_on_failure: When True, stop *submitting* work as soon as any call
            fails; everything not yet started is reported ``blocked`` with a
            run-level reason. This is what :func:`execute` uses, and at
            ``concurrency=1`` it reproduces the historical sequential
            behaviour exactly. Note that at ``concurrency > 1`` calls already
            in flight are **not** cancelled — a fal request cannot be recalled
            once made, and pretending otherwise would discard results that were
            billed anyway.

        All other arguments are as :func:`execute`.

    Three outcome states, not two
    -----------------------------
    ``failed`` and ``blocked`` are different questions for the caller. A failed
    call can be retried verbatim. A blocked one cannot: its input does not
    exist, so it has to be re-planned after its producer succeeds. Any call
    holding a ``"<from N>"`` placeholder whose call ``N`` did not succeed is
    blocked, transitively.

    - ``{"output": "..."}`` (string)                          — LLM endpoints

    The first matching pattern wins. For multi-asset responses (e.g. flux
    with ``num_images > 1``), only the first asset becomes an Artifact —
    callers wanting all assets should provide their own converter.

    Every Artifact is **content-addressed**: ``asset_id`` is the SHA-256 of the
    artifact's bytes, as ``lacing.Artifact`` contractually requires.

    - Media calls: the bytes are streamed once into ``content_store`` (see
      :mod:`falaw.content`), ``bytes_size`` is their real length, ``url`` is
      kept as a *hint*, and the artifact survives fal deleting the URL because
      the bytes are in the store. ``path`` is set when the store exposes a
      local file for the blob (the directory-backed default does; an in-memory
      or object-store one returns ``None`` — read those through
      ``ArtifactStore.iter_blob(asset_id)``). Re-converting the same response
      later is download-free (the ``url -> content hash`` index).
    - ``json`` / ``text`` calls with **no URL** — the ``fal-ai/any-llm`` case:
      the textual response is materialized to a content-addressed file in the
      falaw cache and ``Artifact.path`` points at it.

    Degraded (URL-only) artifacts
    -----------------------------
    Two cases produce an Artifact whose ``asset_id`` is a digest of the whole
    response rather than a content hash, with ``bytes_size == 0``: an explicit
    ``fetch_bytes=False``, and a fetch that failed (which also emits a
    :class:`UserWarning` — see :func:`execute` for why a *billed* result is
    degraded rather than discarded).

    The response digest is deliberately **not** the SHA-256 of the URL. Hashing
    the URL is the falaw#14 defect: it looks like a content hash, so it makes
    two byte-identical renders appear different while satisfying every check
    that only tests "is this 64 hex chars". ``bytes_size == 0`` is the honest
    signal, and it is what downstream key resolution reads to fall back to the
    URL rather than trust the id.

    Note that ``path``/``url`` are location *hints*, machine-local in the
    ``path`` case. Only ``asset_id`` + the content store are portable.
