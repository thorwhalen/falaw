"""Per-call outcomes of running a :class:`falaw.Plan` — the partial-result type.

A :class:`falaw.Plan` is a fan-out: 200 panels is 200 :class:`~falaw.CallPlan`
entries in one Plan. A ``list[Artifact]`` return has no room to say *"call 7
failed, here are the other 199"*, so the only thing a bare list can do when one
call raises is throw the whole run away — including artifacts that were already
generated and **already billed**.

This module is the vocabulary for saying it properly. Three states, not two:

``succeeded``
    The call ran (or was served from cache) and produced an
    :class:`lacing.Artifact`.
``failed``
    The call raised. The exception is kept, so the caller can classify it
    (:mod:`falaw.errors` distinguishes rate-limiting from a locked account)
    and retry precisely this one call.
``blocked``
    The call never ran, because something it depends on did not succeed — a
    ``"<from N>"`` placeholder pointing at a failed upstream — or because the
    run was halted by an earlier failure.

The third state is what makes a chained plan safe to resume: a blocked call
must be *re-planned*, not retried, and a caller that cannot tell "blocked" from
"failed" will retry a call whose input does not exist.

Examples
--------

>>> from falaw.plan import CallPlan
>>> call = CallPlan(tool="generate_image", application="fal-ai/flux/dev",
...                 arguments={"prompt": "a tiger"}, output_kind="image",
...                 estimated_cost_usd=0.025)
>>> boom = CallOutcome(index=0, call=call, status="failed",
...                    error=RuntimeError("content filter"))
>>> boom.ok
False
>>> report = ExecutionReport(outcomes=(boom,))
>>> report.is_complete
False
>>> report.estimated_spend_usd
0.0
>>> [o.index for o in report.failed]
[0]
