  --team TEAM           The team to use.
  --since SINCE         Show terminated runners since the given time. Accepts 'now', relative like '30m', '1h', '1d', or an ISO timestamp. Max 24 hours.
  --state {all,idle,running,pending,setup,crash_backoff,terminated} [{all,idle,running,pending,setup,crash_backoff,terminated} ...]
                        Filter by runner state(s). Choose one or more, or 'all' (default).

  --json                Output in JSON format (same as --output json)
```

The runner table displays the following columns:

* **Alias** — Application name
* **Machine Type** — Hardware type (e.g. `GPU-A100`, `GPU-H100`)
* **Runner ID** — Unique runner identifier
* **In Flight Requests** — Number of active requests
* **Expires In** — Time until runner expires
* **Uptime** — How long the runner has been running
* **Revision** — Application revision
* **State** — Current runner state

## Logs

```bash theme={null}
Usage: fal runners logs [-h] [--output {pretty,json}] [--json] [--team TEAM]
                        [--search SEARCH] [--since SINCE] [--until UNTIL]
                        [--follow] [--lines LINES]
                        id

Show logs for a runner.

Positional Arguments:
  id                    Runner ID.

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --team TEAM           The team to use.
  --search SEARCH       Search for string in logs.
  --since SINCE         Show logs since the given time. Accepts 'now', relative like '30m', '1h', or an ISO timestamp. Defaults to runner start time or to '1m ago' in --follow mode.
  --until UNTIL         Show logs until the given time. Accepts 'now', relative like '30m', '1h', or an ISO timestamp. Defaults to runner finish time or 'now' if it is still running.
  --follow, -f          Follow logs live. If --since is not specified, implies '--since 1m ago'.
  --lines, -n LINES     Only show latest N log lines. If '+' prefix is used, show oldest N log lines. Ignored if --follow is used.

Output:
  --output {pretty,json}
                        Modify the command output
  --json                Output in JSON format (same as --output json)
```

## Stop

```bash theme={null}
Usage: fal runners stop [-h] [--team TEAM] id

Stop a runner gracefully.

Positional Arguments:
  id           Runner ID.

Options:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  --team TEAM  The team to use.
```

## Kill

```bash theme={null}
Usage: fal runners kill [-h] [--team TEAM] id

Kill a runner.

Positional Arguments:
  id           Runner ID.

Options:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  --team TEAM  The team to use.
```

## Shell

```bash theme={null}
Usage: fal runners shell [-h] [--team TEAM] id

Open an interactive shell session inside a running runner.

Positional Arguments:
  id           Runner ID.

Options:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  --team TEAM  The team to use.
```

### Use Cases

* **Debug running code**: Inspect the runtime environment of a live runner
* **Check dependencies**: Verify installed packages and their versions
* **Examine state**: Inspect files, environment variables, and runtime state
* **Troubleshoot issues**: Diagnose problems in production runners

### Example

Connect to a running runner:

```bash theme={null}
# Get runner ID from runners list
fal runners list

# Connect to the runner
fal runners shell runner_abc123xyz
```

Once connected, you have full shell access within the runner's container environment. Press `Ctrl+D` or type `exit` to disconnect.

## Exec

Run a one-off command on a runner without opening an interactive shell.

```bash theme={null}
Usage: fal runners exec [-h] [--team TEAM] [-it] id [command ...]

Execute a command on a runner.

Positional Arguments:
  id                  Runner ID.
  command             Command to execute (after `--`).

Options:
  -h, --help          show this help message and exit
  --team TEAM         The team to use.
  -it, --interactive  Allocate a TTY and attach stdin (interactive mode).
```

The command and its arguments are passed after a `--` separator so they aren't parsed as flags by the `fal` CLI.

### Examples

```bash theme={null}
# Print environment variables on the runner
fal runners exec runner_abc123xyz -- env

# Tail an arbitrary log file inside the container
fal runners exec runner_abc123xyz -- tail -f /var/log/my-app.log

# Run an interactive Python REPL
fal runners exec runner_abc123xyz -it -- python
```

## GPUs

Show a GPU usage summary across all runners in the account.

```bash theme={null}
Usage: fal runners gpus [-h] [--output {pretty,json}] [--json] [--team TEAM]

Show GPU usage summary across runners.

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --team TEAM           The team to use.

Output:
  --output {pretty,json}
                        Modify the command output
  --json                Output in JSON format (same as --output json)
```

For the GPUs behind a single application rather than the whole account, see
[`fal apps gpus`](/docs/api-reference/cli/apps/gpus).
