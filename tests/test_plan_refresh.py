"""Tests for the third cache mode — ``refresh=True``: skip the read, keep the write.

The defect these pin down (falaw#49, observed downstream as thorwhalen/reelee#384):
``use_cache`` was one flag doing two jobs, so a caller who reached for
``use_cache=False`` to mean *"ignore any cached answer"* also got *"and discard
the fresh one"*. That turns "re-verify this plan" into a guaranteed double
charge, because the next consumer re-bills the result the forced run already
paid for and threw away.

Every fal call here goes through a **counting** fake ``fal_client``, so the
assertions are on vendor-call counts — the unit the defect is measured in — not
on cache internals. Nothing reaches a paid API; the suite's autouse offline
fixtures (``tests/conftest.py``) cover the asset transport and the on-disk
stores.
