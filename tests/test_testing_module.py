"""``falaw.testing`` — the fake asset transport falaw owns so consumers don't.

Every test here is a guard on a property that was *measured* downstream and
that a naive shared helper would quietly lose (thorwhalen/falaw#27):

* the fake must reach every entry point, including a consumer module that
  bound ``falaw.execute_plan`` at import time;
* it must reach a thread the installer never created;
* an explicit ``fetcher=`` must still win;
* ``file://`` must not be faked;
* and — the one that keeps biting — **refusing is not reporting**: falaw
  funnels a failed fetch through ``except Exception`` and *degrades* it to a
  URL-only artifact with a warning, so a guard that only raises leaves the
  suite green with the regression back in place. Both the fake and the network
  guard therefore *record*, and the recording is what is asserted.

Note the issue's claim that ``execute_isolated`` catches ``BaseException`` into
an outcome is **wrong** — ``_outcome_from_future`` re-raises a non-``Exception``
deliberately. The two tests at the bottom pin down what actually happens in
each case, so neither belief has to be taken on trust again.
