"""Regression guards for falaw#14 — identify media by *what it is*, not *where*.

Two defects, one confusion:

* **D3** — ``Artifact.asset_id`` was ``sha256(url)``, so two byte-identical
  renders got different ids and ``lacing.Artifact``'s content-hash contract was
  false for every media artifact falaw produced.
* **D1** — the upstream *URL* went into the downstream cache key, so a
  byte-identical upstream regeneration missed downstream and re-billed a
  $0.35–$1.50 clip for work that had not changed.

fal's own docs are the primary source for why a URL cannot carry identity:
"Each upload produces a unique URL with no shared namespace" and "Expired files
are permanently deleted and cannot be recovered."

The load-bearing tests here are:

* :func:`test_same_bytes_at_a_new_url_hits_the_downstream_cache` — D1's fix.
* :func:`test_changed_upstream_bytes_miss_the_downstream_cache` — the other
  half: a key change must still *happen* when the input really changed, or the
  fix would trade a wasteful miss for a wrong hit.
* :func:`test_the_wire_gets_the_url_and_the_key_gets_the_content_hash` — the
  split that makes both possible without sending a content hash to fal.
